# Stripchart using ggplot2
 
This script was pulled together to create stripchart in R using ggplot2. Stripchart in R can help visualize distribution unlike box plots and can be done using two packages: 
1) ggstripchart
2)ggPlot
Here I used both of these packages to create and customize stripcharts as required for my publication. 

Example datasets used to create stripchart using these code will also be published soon.
